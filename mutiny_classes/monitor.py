# Copy this file to your project's mutiny classes directory to
# implement a long-running thread to monitor your target
# This is useful for watching files, logs, remote connections,
# PIDs, etc in parallel while mutiny is operating
# This parallel thread can signal Mutiny when it detects a crash

    # This function will run asynchronously in a different thread to monitor the host

        #   read file, etc

        #       signalMain()
